# Dictionary Project

Welcome to the **Dictionary Project**! This project is a compilation of exercises to work with dictionaries and explores concepts such as class creation, working with collections, and implementing logic to solve problems. The project includes command-line interaction, Python object-oriented programming, and the ability to execute tests with `pytest` integrated with GitHub Actions for continuous integration.

## Project Description

This project consists of tasks that involve working with a dictionary-like structure. Three main exercises have been implemented:

1. **Creating and Managing a Dictionary**  
   This includes the ability to add new entries with names and descriptions and search for specific information in the dictionary.

2. **Shopping List Cost Calculator**  
   Given a dictionary of items and their costs, along with an array of items bought, this module calculates the total cost of the items, including a user-specified tax. If an item isn't found in the cost list, it is ignored.

3. **String Word Assembly**  
   Takes an array of words and concatenates the nth letter from each word, where `n` is the position of the word in the list.

The program is interactive, operating as a command-line menu-driven application.
